day 3
- feels unstructured when writing code, keep forgetting where I am
- should clearly define logic steps before start writing, aka take notes
- use more functions to simplify repetition
  - in today's task, traversing adjacent is a pain, causes many typo bugs
  - better use function(i,j) and use for (i,j) in list of <adjacent i,j> B
  
day4
- good noting steps before starting to code
- should've more details on parsing, data struct used to store values
- timer to keep track of time used? but I dont really speed run, more like coding and snoozing
- forgot to write down steps for part 2
